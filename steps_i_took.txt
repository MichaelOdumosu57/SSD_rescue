2/6/19
so I plugged the ac adaptor to give power to the laptop

2/6/19 10:55pm
I press power and Esc
there is a long pause, then it asks to install an OS on my hard disk

I run f2
I choose Memory Test

I plug in AC adapter
I noticed that its the advanced Hardware Diagnostics UEFI

It passed


on Hard Drive Check -i clicked quick check
img:m_r_19
the UEFI did not see the drive

on extensive check I see that no hardrive installed as well

I exited diagnostics

I went to F10 and back nothing


I placed the windows recovery tool into a usb port on the machine and hit f9
img:m_r_20
I attempted to boot from the USB, hopefully it has an MBR
img:m_r_16
I got the hp logo
img:m_r_15
now its loading

I got to the windows recovery section
I enter on the defualts
I choose repair your computer

    I choose turn off pc because I want to see what Gparted has to say about the drive

I placed the gparted bootable and try to boot as regular
i get that familar COMRESET failed error
img:m_r_14
other things came on the screen, but i didnt get it in time
Gparted booted regular but it can't connect to the drive
img:m_r_8

I turned it off and placed ubuntu bootable instead
I choose check disk for defects
img:m_r_6

it shows that comreset error but it is eventually able to access the /boot directory
img:m_r_4
    its moving
    img:m_r_11,
    it says check finished no errors found
    img:m_r_10
    i pressed to reboot the system

I clicked try ubuntu without installing
i get the COMRESET error but a lot less
it goes ahead and boots into the bootable OS
it probably rewrote the MBR it needs to boot
I shutdown


I place the usb bootable and boot again into windows recovery
I quickly see I cannot so I go to command prompt
im able to access C://but I see that C represents the bootable
img:m_r_13
I ran in the command prompt


bootrec.exe /fixmbr
    operation completed sucessfully
bootrec.exe /rebuildbcd
    0 installations
